# Banner-Grabber
A simple program which scans open ports and tries to retrieve the message sent by the service. In short, a basic banner grabber. Sometimes, helpful during CTF (capture the flag) challenges or other security assessments.

The program requires a range of ports to scan. Offers 2 modes: the first one allows to simply display the message from the listening service. The second one displays more information about what port is open, the banner or informs that the port is open, but no banner could be retrieved.
